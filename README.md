# MoodMe-Facial-Analysis

My website uses the open source python library of DeepFace to analyze faces. The face is input using the website on port 5000, and the file is checked to ensure a valid face. The neural network proceeds to run, and emotions detected are output in percentages, including the dominant emotion present. Afterwards, the photo files are removed using the remove_file function.
